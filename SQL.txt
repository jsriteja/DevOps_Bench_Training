1.What is SQL?
	SQL stands for Structured Query Language
	SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
	SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

2.However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

3.SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

4.Semicolon after SQL Statements?
	Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

	Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

	In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

5.Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
	SELECT - extracts data from a database
	UPDATE - updates data in a database
	DELETE - deletes data from a database
	INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
	CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
	ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
	CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
	ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
	DROP TABLE - deletes a table
	CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
	DROP INDEX - deletes an index

6.The SQL SELECT Statement
	The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

	The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

  SELECT Syntax
	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name;

7.SELECT * Example:-
	The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "Customers" table:

  Example:
	SELECT * FROM Customers;

8.The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
	The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

	Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

  SELECT DISTINCT Syntax:
	SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name;

9.The SQL WHERE Clause
	The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

	It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition
